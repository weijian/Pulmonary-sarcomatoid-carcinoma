**Abstract**

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 0.1-0.4% of all lung malignancies. The diagnosis of PSC on small biopsy specimens presents significant challenges due to its morphological overlap with reactive spindle cell proliferations and other mesenchymal neoplasms. We report a case of a 74-year-old woman who presented with a left upper lobe lung mass initially misinterpreted as an inflammatory necrotic lesion on needle biopsy. The tumor was composed of small, atypical spindle cells with subtle nuclear atypia embedded in an inflammatory and necrotic background. Initial immunohistochemistry revealed CK(+), TTF-1(+), Napsin A(-), CK7(-), and SMA(-), which raised diagnostic uncertainty. Supplementary immunohistochemical staining demonstrated Vimentin(+), CAM5.2(+), p53(+, 60%), and ALK(-), supporting the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma with adenocarcinoma differentiation. This case highlights the morphological pitfalls in diagnosing PSC on needle biopsy and emphasizes the critical role of a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel in establishing the correct diagnosis. We review the current WHO classification, NCCN guidelines, and recent literature on the immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of PSC, with particular attention to diagnostic considerations in small biopsy specimens.

**Introduction**

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) represents a heterogeneous group of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinomas characterized by the presence of spindle cells, giant cells, or both.[[1]](#national-comprehensive-cancer-network.-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.)[[2]](#travis-wd.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21043818">sarcomatoid-neoplasms-of-the-lung-and-pleura</a>.-archives-of-pathology-&-laboratory-medicine.-2010;134\(11\):1645-58.-doi:10.1043/2010-0086-rar.1.) According to the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic Tumors, sarcomatoid carcinoma encompasses five distinct subtypes: pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma.[[3]](#nicholson-ag,-tsao-ms,-beasley-mb,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34808341">the-2021-who-classification-of-lung-tumors:-impact-of-advances-since-2015</a>.-journal-of-thoracic-oncology-:-official-publication-of-the-international-association-for-the-study-of-lung-cancer.-2022;17\(3\):362-387.-doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2021.11.003.) These tumors are unified by their aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 20% to 35%.[[4]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-correa-am,-moran-ca.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993578">"sarcomatoid"-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-a-clinicopathological-study-of-86-cases-with-a-new-perspective-on-tumor-classification</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;63:14-26.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.12.010.)[[5]](#rossi-g,-cavazza-a,-sturm-n,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12604887">pulmonary-carcinomas-with-pleomorphic,-sarcomatoid,-or-sarcomatous-elements:-a-clinicopathologic-and-immunohistochemical-study-of-75-cases</a>.-the-american-journal-of-surgical-pathology.-2003;27\(3\):311-24.-doi:10.1097/00000478-200303000-00004.)

The diagnosis of PSC presents unique challenges, particularly in small biopsy specimens. Unlike resection specimens where the characteristic biphasic morphology and heterogeneous architecture can be appreciated, needle biopsies often sample only a limited portion of the tumor, potentially capturing only the sarcomatoid component without recognizable epithelial differentiation.[[2]](#travis-wd.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21043818">sarcomatoid-neoplasms-of-the-lung-and-pleura</a>.-archives-of-pathology-&-laboratory-medicine.-2010;134\(11\):1645-58.-doi:10.1043/2010-0086-rar.1.) This sampling limitation, combined with the morphological overlap between PSC and various benign and malignant spindle cell lesions, creates significant diagnostic pitfalls that may lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.[[6]](#hummel-p,-cangiarella-jf,-cohen-jm,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11391606">transthoracic-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-of-pulmonary-spindle-cell-and-mesenchymal-lesions:-a-study-of-61-cases</a>.-cancer.-2001;93\(3\):187-98.-doi:10.1002/cncr.9028.)

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines emphasize that sarcomatoid carcinoma is classified as a type of NSCLC and should be managed accordingly, including comprehensive molecular testing for actionable mutations.[[1]](#national-comprehensive-cancer-network.-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.) Recent studies have demonstrated that PSC harbors a high frequency of MET exon 14 skipping mutations (22-31.8%), significantly higher than conventional NSCLC subtypes, making accurate diagnosis essential for guiding targeted therapy.[[7]](#liu-x,-jia-y,-stoopler-mb,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26215952">next-generation-sequencing-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-reveals-high-frequency-of-actionable-met-gene-mutations</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2016;34\(8\):794-802.-doi:10.1200/jco.2015.62.0674.)[[8]](#chakravarty-d,-johnson-a,-sklar-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.21.02767?url_ver=z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">somatic-genomic-testing-in-patients-with-metastatic-or-advanced-cancer:-asco-provisional-clinical-opinion</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2022;40\(11\):1231-1258.-doi:10.1200/jco.21.02767.)

We present a challenging case of PSC diagnosed on needle biopsy, initially misinterpreted as an inflammatory necrotic lesion due to the subtle morphological features and inflammatory background. This case illustrates the diagnostic pitfalls encountered in small biopsy specimens and highlights the importance of a systematic immunohistochemical approach in establishing the correct diagnosis.

**Case Presentation**

**Clinical History**

A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of "lung mass detected on imaging 5 days ago." The patient had no significant respiratory symptoms at presentation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a mass in the left upper lobe near the hilum, accompanied by multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. The radiological impression was suggestive of primary lung carcinoma with obstructive pneumonia and possible bilateral pulmonary metastases. Enhanced CT was recommended for further characterization.

**Pathological Findings**

CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left lung mass was performed. The initial histopathological examination revealed the following features:

_Microscopic Description:_

The biopsy specimen showed fragments of lung parenchyma with alveolar structures and hyperplastic alveolar epithelium. There was prominent interstitial lymphocytic infiltration consistent with obstructive pneumonia. Additionally, areas of interstitial spindle cell proliferation were identified, accompanied by scattered epithelioid cells and surrounded by inflammatory necrotic tissue.

Figure 2: High-power view demonstrating small, atypical spindle cells with subtle nuclear atypia (H.E. ×400)

The target cells were small and spindle-shaped with subtle nuclear atypia. The cells exhibited elongated nuclei with mild hyperchromasia and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures were present but not prominent. The overall impression was initially suggestive of an inflammatory necrotic lesion, and the possibility of reactive fibroblastic proliferation was considered.

_Initial Immunohistochemical Panel:_

The first panel of immunohistochemical stains yielded the following results:

- CK (pan-cytokeratin): Positive

- CK7: Negative

- TTF-1: Positive

- Napsin A: Negative

- CK5/6: Negative

- P40: Negative

- Ki-67: Positive (index ~50%)

- Desmin: Negative

- SMA (smooth muscle actin): Negative  

<img width="100%"  alt="Snip20260226_47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e34b64-03e9-4a11-9306-940d55d601b5" />

Figure 3: Immunohistochemistry panel showing CK(+), TTF-1(+), Napsin A(-), SMA(-)

The immunohistochemical profile was perplexing. The positivity for CK and TTF-1 suggested epithelial origin and pulmonary differentiation, while the negativity for Napsin A, CK7, and squamous markers (CK5/6, P40) was atypical for conventional lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The negativity for SMA and Desmin argued against myofibroblastic differentiation.

_Supplementary Immunohistochemical Panel:_

Given the diagnostic uncertainty, additional immunohistochemical stains were performed:

- p53: Positive (index ~60%, diffuse strong pattern)

- CAM5.2: Positive

- Vimentin: Positive

- MOC-31: Negative

- ALK: Negative

<img width="100%"  alt="Snip20260226_54" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a9306e-26c5-4059-ad0f-ec8abe94f9d0" />

_Final Diagnosis:_

Based on the combined morphological and immunohistochemical findings, the final diagnosis was rendered as: **Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma subtype, with adenocarcinoma differentiation.**

**Discussion**

**Morphological Pitfalls in Needle Biopsy Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of PSC on needle biopsy specimens represents one of the most challenging scenarios in pulmonary pathology. Several morphological pitfalls contributed to the initial diagnostic difficulty in our case:

_1. Subtle Cytological Atypia:_

Unlike conventional carcinomas that typically display overt malignant features, the spindle cells in PSC may exhibit only mild to moderate nuclear atypia, particularly in well-differentiated areas.[[2]](#travis-wd.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21043818">sarcomatoid-neoplasms-of-the-lung-and-pleura</a>.-archives-of-pathology-&-laboratory-medicine.-2010;134\(11\):1645-58.-doi:10.1043/2010-0086-rar.1.)[[9]](#weissferdt-a.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29912718">pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinomas:-a-review</a>.-advances-in-anatomic-pathology.-2018;25\(5\):304-313.-doi:10.1097/pap.0000000000000202.) In our case, the target cells were small with subtle nuclear abnormalities, leading to initial consideration of reactive fibroblastic proliferation. Travis et al. emphasized that spindle cell carcinomas may show deceptively bland cytological features, making distinction from benign spindle cell lesions challenging.[[2]](#travis-wd.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21043818">sarcomatoid-neoplasms-of-the-lung-and-pleura</a>.-archives-of-pathology-&-laboratory-medicine.-2010;134\(11\):1645-58.-doi:10.1043/2010-0086-rar.1.)

_2. Inflammatory and Necrotic Background:_

The presence of prominent inflammatory infiltrates and necrosis can obscure the malignant spindle cell population and mimic inflammatory conditions.[[10]](#wick-mr,-ritter-jh,-nappi-o.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672783">inflammatory-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-of-the-lung:-report-of-three-cases-and-clinicopathologic-comparison-with-inflammatory-pseudotumors-in-adult-patients</a>.-human-pathology.-1995;26\(9\):1014-21.-doi:10.1016/0046-8177\(95\)90092-6.) Wick et al. described "inflammatory sarcomatoid carcinoma" as a distinct variant that closely resembles inflammatory pseudotumor, with uniform spindle cell proliferations showing modest nuclear pleomorphism and limited mitotic activity.[[10]](#wick-mr,-ritter-jh,-nappi-o.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672783">inflammatory-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-of-the-lung:-report-of-three-cases-and-clinicopathologic-comparison-with-inflammatory-pseudotumors-in-adult-patients</a>.-human-pathology.-1995;26\(9\):1014-21.-doi:10.1016/0046-8177\(95\)90092-6.) Our case demonstrated similar features with lymphocytic infiltration and necrotic debris surrounding the tumor cells.

_3. Absence of Recognizable Epithelial Component:_

In resection specimens, PSC typically shows areas of conventional carcinoma (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) admixed with the sarcomatoid component.[[4]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-correa-am,-moran-ca.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993578">"sarcomatoid"-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-a-clinicopathological-study-of-86-cases-with-a-new-perspective-on-tumor-classification</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;63:14-26.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.12.010.)[[5]](#rossi-g,-cavazza-a,-sturm-n,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12604887">pulmonary-carcinomas-with-pleomorphic,-sarcomatoid,-or-sarcomatous-elements:-a-clinicopathologic-and-immunohistochemical-study-of-75-cases</a>.-the-american-journal-of-surgical-pathology.-2003;27\(3\):311-24.-doi:10.1097/00000478-200303000-00004.) However, needle biopsies may sample only the sarcomatoid areas, lacking the diagnostic epithelial component that would facilitate recognition of the carcinomatous nature.[[2]](#travis-wd.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21043818">sarcomatoid-neoplasms-of-the-lung-and-pleura</a>.-archives-of-pathology-&-laboratory-medicine.-2010;134\(11\):1645-58.-doi:10.1043/2010-0086-rar.1.) Studies have shown that approximately 44% of PSC cases fail to show a specific immunophenotype that would allow reclassification as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.)

_4. Sampling Limitations:_

The inherent heterogeneity of PSC poses significant sampling challenges. Weissferdt et al. demonstrated that in 28% of cases, the immunophenotype in the spindle/giant cell component was less lineage-specific than in the differentiated component.[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.) This finding underscores the importance of recognizing that a single biopsy may not capture the full spectrum of tumor differentiation.

**Differential Diagnosis of Pulmonary Spindle Cell Lesions**

The differential diagnosis of spindle cell lesions in lung biopsy specimens is broad and includes both benign and malignant entities:[[6]](#hummel-p,-cangiarella-jf,-cohen-jm,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11391606">transthoracic-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-of-pulmonary-spindle-cell-and-mesenchymal-lesions:-a-study-of-61-cases</a>.-cancer.-2001;93\(3\):187-98.-doi:10.1002/cncr.9028.)[[12]](#boyraz-b,-hung-yp.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942046">spindle-cell-tumors-of-the-pleura-and-the-peritoneum:-pathologic-diagnosis-and-updates</a>.-apmis-:-acta-pathologica,-microbiologica,-et-immunologica-scandinavica.-2022;130\(3\):140-154.-doi:10.1111/apm.13203.)

_1. Reactive/Inflammatory Lesions:_

- Organizing pneumonia

- Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)

- IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor

- Granulomatous inflammation

_2. Benign Neoplasms:_

- Solitary fibrous tumor

- Schwannoma

- Hamartoma with spindle cell component

_3. Malignant Neoplasms:_

- Sarcomatoid carcinoma (spindle cell carcinoma, pleomorphic carcinoma)

- Sarcomatoid mesothelioma

- Primary pulmonary sarcomas (synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma)

- Metastatic spindle cell tumors (melanoma, sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma)

- Spindle cell carcinoid tumor

Hummel et al. reviewed 61 transthoracic fine-needle aspiration biopsies with spindle cell morphology and found that 54% were reactive processes, while 38% were malignant neoplasms.[[6]](#hummel-p,-cangiarella-jf,-cohen-jm,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11391606">transthoracic-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-of-pulmonary-spindle-cell-and-mesenchymal-lesions:-a-study-of-61-cases</a>.-cancer.-2001;93\(3\):187-98.-doi:10.1002/cncr.9028.) This distribution highlights the importance of careful evaluation to avoid both false-positive and false-negative diagnoses.

**Role of Immunohistochemistry in Diagnosis**

Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in establishing the diagnosis of PSC and excluding morphological mimics. Based on our case and the literature, we propose a systematic immunohistochemical approach:

_First-Line Panel (Essential Markers):_

1. **Cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, Oscar):** Cytokeratin positivity is the cornerstone for confirming epithelial differentiation in spindle cell tumors. Studies have shown that AE1/AE3 is positive in 100% of PSC cases, while CAM5.2 shows positivity in 89-93%. Importantly, CAM5.2 may be less sensitive than broad-spectrum keratins, as observed in our case where CK7 was negative but CAM5.2 was positive.[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.)[[13]](#terra-sb,-aubry-mc,-yi-es,-boland-jm.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24331839">immunohistochemical-study-of-36-cases-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma--sensitivity-of-ttf-1-is-superior-to-napsin</a>.-human-pathology.-2014;45\(2\):294-302.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2013.09.005.)

2. **TTF-1:** TTF-1 positivity supports pulmonary origin and is present in 41-61% of PSC cases. Terra et al. demonstrated that TTF-1 sensitivity (61%) is superior to Napsin A (39%) in PSC. The TTF-1 positivity in our case was crucial for establishing pulmonary origin.[[5]](#rossi-g,-cavazza-a,-sturm-n,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12604887">pulmonary-carcinomas-with-pleomorphic,-sarcomatoid,-or-sarcomatous-elements:-a-clinicopathologic-and-immunohistochemical-study-of-75-cases</a>.-the-american-journal-of-surgical-pathology.-2003;27\(3\):311-24.-doi:10.1097/00000478-200303000-00004.)[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.)[[13]](#terra-sb,-aubry-mc,-yi-es,-boland-jm.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24331839">immunohistochemical-study-of-36-cases-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma--sensitivity-of-ttf-1-is-superior-to-napsin</a>.-human-pathology.-2014;45\(2\):294-302.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2013.09.005.)

3. **Napsin A:** Napsin A shows lower sensitivity (20-39%) in PSC compared to conventional adenocarcinoma. Negativity for Napsin A should not exclude the diagnosis of PSC with adenocarcinoma differentiation.[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.)[[13]](#terra-sb,-aubry-mc,-yi-es,-boland-jm.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24331839">immunohistochemical-study-of-36-cases-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma--sensitivity-of-ttf-1-is-superior-to-napsin</a>.-human-pathology.-2014;45\(2\):294-302.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2013.09.005.)

4. **Vimentin:** Vimentin positivity is nearly universal in the sarcomatoid component of PSC, reflecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The co-expression of cytokeratin and vimentin is characteristic of PSC and helps distinguish it from pure sarcomas.[[14]](#huang-y,-guo-j,-li-s,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165833">the-correlation-between-histologic,-immunophenotypic,-and-molecular-characteristics-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-reveals-that-sarcomatoid-change-is-potentially-derived-from-epithelial-carcinoma-cells-undergoing-epithelial-mesenchymal-transition</a>.-applied-immunohistochemistry-&-molecular-morphology-:-aimm.-2023;31\(1\):17-25.-doi:10.1097/pai.0000000000001060.)[[15]](#chen-y,-wang-c,-xiao-c,-et-al.-expression-of-m6a-related-factors-in-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma.-pathology,-research-and-practice.-2025;272:156107.-doi:10.1016/j.prp.2025.156107.)

_Second-Line Panel (Differential Diagnosis):_

5. **ALK:** ALK immunohistochemistry is essential for excluding inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), which shows ALK positivity in 40-60% of cases. ALK negativity in our case helped exclude IMT from the differential diagnosis.[[16]](#bhagat-p,-bal-a,-das-a,-singh-n,-singh-h.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24100523">pulmonary-inflammatory-myofibroblastic-tumor-and-igg4-related-inflammatory-pseudotumor:-a-diagnostic-dilemma</a>.-virchows-archiv-:-an-international-journal-of-pathology.-2013;463\(6\):743-7.-doi:10.1007/s00428-013-1493-2.)[[17]](#qiu-x,-montgomery-e,-sun-b.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18400254">inflammatory-myofibroblastic-tumor-and-low-grade-myofibroblastic-sarcoma:-a-comparative-study-of-clinicopathologic-features-and-further-observations-on-the-immunohistochemical-profile-of-myofibroblasts</a>.-human-pathology.-2008;39\(6\):846-56.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2007.10.010.)

6. **p53:** Diffuse strong p53 expression (mutant pattern) supports malignancy and helps distinguish PSC from reactive spindle cell proliferations. Ansari-Lari et al. showed that 78% of sarcomatoid carcinomas display p53 overexpression, compared to only 5% of reactive lesions.[[18]](#ansari-lari-ma,-hoque-mo,-califano-j,-westra-wh.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170089">immunohistochemical-p53-expression-patterns-in-sarcomatoid-carcinomas-of-the-upper-respiratory-tract</a>.-the-american-journal-of-surgical-pathology.-2002;26\(8\):1024-31.-doi:10.1097/00000478-200208000-00007.)

7. **SMA and Desmin:** Negativity for these markers helps exclude smooth muscle tumors and myofibroblastic lesions. In our case, SMA and Desmin negativity argued against IMT and leiomyosarcoma.

8. **Mesothelial Markers (Calretinin, WT1, D2-40):** These markers may be variably positive in PSC (calretinin 20-33%, WT1 17%, D2-40 6-14%). However, diffuse positivity for multiple mesothelial markers favors sarcomatoid mesothelioma over PSC.[[11]](#weissferdt-a,-kalhor-n,-rodriguez-canales-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569293">spindle-cell-and-pleomorphic-\("sarcomatoid"\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-an-immunohistochemical-analysis-of-86-cases</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;59:1-9.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2016.08.003.)[[13]](#terra-sb,-aubry-mc,-yi-es,-boland-jm.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24331839">immunohistochemical-study-of-36-cases-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma--sensitivity-of-ttf-1-is-superior-to-napsin</a>.-human-pathology.-2014;45\(2\):294-302.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2013.09.005.)[[19]](#lucas-dr,-pass-hi,-madan-sk,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12605647">sarcomatoid-mesothelioma-and-its-histological-mimics:-a-comparative-immunohistochemical-study</a>.-histopathology.-2003;42\(3\):270-9.-doi:10.1046/j.1365-2559.2003.01583.x.)

_Immunohistochemical Profile Summary:_

- Napsin A: 20-39% positive

- Vimentin: ~100% positive (sarcomatoid component)

- CK5/6: 9-25% positive

- p40: 8% positive

**Distinguishing PSC from Key Differential Diagnoses**

_1. Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor (IMT):_

IMT is characterized by myofibroblastic spindle cell proliferation with prominent inflammatory infiltrate.[[16]](#bhagat-p,-bal-a,-das-a,-singh-n,-singh-h.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24100523">pulmonary-inflammatory-myofibroblastic-tumor-and-igg4-related-inflammatory-pseudotumor:-a-diagnostic-dilemma</a>.-virchows-archiv-:-an-international-journal-of-pathology.-2013;463\(6\):743-7.-doi:10.1007/s00428-013-1493-2.)[[17]](#qiu-x,-montgomery-e,-sun-b.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18400254">inflammatory-myofibroblastic-tumor-and-low-grade-myofibroblastic-sarcoma:-a-comparative-study-of-clinicopathologic-features-and-further-observations-on-the-immunohistochemical-profile-of-myofibroblasts</a>.-human-pathology.-2008;39\(6\):846-56.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2007.10.010.) Key distinguishing features include:

- ALK positivity in 40-60% of IMT (negative in PSC)

- SMA positivity in IMT (usually negative in PSC)

- TTF-1 negativity in IMT (positive in ~50% of PSC)

- Cytokeratin may be positive in both (13.6% of IMT)

_2. Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma:_

The distinction between PSC and sarcomatoid mesothelioma can be challenging, particularly in pleural-based tumors.[[20]](#marchevsky-am,-lestang-n,-hiroshima-k,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28782639">the-differential-diagnosis-between-pleural-sarcomatoid-mesothelioma-and-spindle-cell/pleomorphic-\(sarcomatoid\)-carcinomas-of-the-lung:-evidence-based-guidelines-from-the-international-mesothelioma-panel-and-the-mesopath-national-reference-center</a>.-human-pathology.-2017;67:160-168.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2017.07.015.) Key considerations include:

- Clinical and radiological correlation is essential

- Diffuse pleural involvement favors mesothelioma

- TTF-1 positivity strongly favors PSC (negative in mesothelioma)

- Calretinin and other mesothelial markers may be positive in both

_3. Reactive Spindle Cell Proliferation:_

Reactive fibroblastic proliferations lack cytokeratin expression and show bland cytological features without mitotic activity.[[10]](#wick-mr,-ritter-jh,-nappi-o.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672783">inflammatory-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-of-the-lung:-report-of-three-cases-and-clinicopathologic-comparison-with-inflammatory-pseudotumors-in-adult-patients</a>.-human-pathology.-1995;26\(9\):1014-21.-doi:10.1016/0046-8177\(95\)90092-6.) The combination of cytokeratin positivity, TTF-1 positivity, and p53 overexpression in our case effectively excluded a reactive process.

**Molecular Pathology Advances**

Recent molecular studies have revealed that PSC harbors a distinct genomic landscape with important therapeutic implications:[[7]](#liu-x,-jia-y,-stoopler-mb,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26215952">next-generation-sequencing-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-reveals-high-frequency-of-actionable-met-gene-mutations</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2016;34\(8\):794-802.-doi:10.1200/jco.2015.62.0674.)[[21]](#yang-z,-xu-j,-li-l,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985499">integrated-molecular-characterization-reveals-potential-therapeutic-strategies-for-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma</a>.-nature-communications.-2020;11\(1\):4878.-doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18702-3.)[[22]](#pécuchet-n,-vieira-t,-rabbe-n,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28419182">molecular-classification-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinomas-suggests-new-therapeutic-opportunities</a>.-annals-of-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-european-society-for-medical-oncology.-2017;28\(7\):1597-1604.-doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx162.)

_MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations:_

MET exon 14 skipping mutations occur in 22-31.8% of PSC cases, significantly higher than the 2-3% prevalence in conventional NSCLC.[[7]](#liu-x,-jia-y,-stoopler-mb,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26215952">next-generation-sequencing-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-reveals-high-frequency-of-actionable-met-gene-mutations</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2016;34\(8\):794-802.-doi:10.1200/jco.2015.62.0674.)[[8]](#chakravarty-d,-johnson-a,-sklar-j,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.21.02767?url_ver=z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">somatic-genomic-testing-in-patients-with-metastatic-or-advanced-cancer:-asco-provisional-clinical-opinion</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2022;40\(11\):1231-1258.-doi:10.1200/jco.21.02767.) This mutation results in increased MET protein stability and oncogenic signaling. The FDA has approved capmatinib and tepotinib for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations.[[23]](#mathieu-ln,-larkins-e,-akinboro-o,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34344795">fda-approval-summary:-capmatinib-and-tepotinib-for-the-treatment-of-metastatic-nsclc-harboring-met-exon-14-skipping-mutations-or-alterations</a>.-clinical-cancer-research-:-an-official-journal-of-the-american-association-for-cancer-research.-2022;28\(2\):249-254.-doi:10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-21-1566.)[[24]](#u.s.-food-and-drug-administration.-orange-book:-approved-drug-products-with-therapeutic-equivalence-evaluations.-u.s.-department-of-health-and-human-services.) Liu et al. demonstrated dramatic responses to crizotinib in patients with PSC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations.[[7]](#liu-x,-jia-y,-stoopler-mb,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26215952">next-generation-sequencing-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-reveals-high-frequency-of-actionable-met-gene-mutations</a>.-journal-of-clinical-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology.-2016;34\(8\):794-802.-doi:10.1200/jco.2015.62.0674.)

_Other Actionable Mutations:_

PSC may also harbor other targetable alterations, including:[[21]](#yang-z,-xu-j,-li-l,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985499">integrated-molecular-characterization-reveals-potential-therapeutic-strategies-for-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma</a>.-nature-communications.-2020;11\(1\):4878.-doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18702-3.)[[22]](#pécuchet-n,-vieira-t,-rabbe-n,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28419182">molecular-classification-of-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinomas-suggests-new-therapeutic-opportunities</a>.-annals-of-oncology-:-official-journal-of-the-european-society-for-medical-oncology.-2017;28\(7\):1597-1604.-doi:10.1093/annonc/mdx162.)[[25]](#forest-f,-yvorel-v,-karpathiou-g,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26826416">histomolecular-profiling-of-pleomorphic,-spindle-cell,-and-giant-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung-for-targeted-therapies</a>.-human-pathology.-2016;49:99-106.-doi:10.1016/j.humpath.2015.10.006.)

- KRAS mutations (18-30%)

- EGFR mutations (2.7-22%, higher in TTF-1 positive cases)

- BRAF mutations (3-7%)

- ALK fusions (1-3%)

- TP53 mutations (58-69%)

_PD-L1 Expression and Immunotherapy:_

PSC demonstrates high PD-L1 expression, with 73-82% of cases showing high expression (TPS ≥50%).[[26]](#hong-l,-di-federico-a,-liu-b,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40716572">distinct-clinicogenomic-features-and-immunotherapy-associations-in-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma:-a-multi-center-retrospective-study</a>.-journal-of-thoracic-oncology-:-official-publication-of-the-international-association-for-the-study-of-lung-cancer.-2025;:s1556-0864\(25\)00967-0.-doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2025.07.121.) Recent studies suggest that PSC patients may achieve comparable outcomes with immunotherapy compared to other NSCLC subtypes, despite historically poor prognosis with chemotherapy.[[26]](#hong-l,-di-federico-a,-liu-b,-et-al.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40716572">distinct-clinicogenomic-features-and-immunotherapy-associations-in-pulmonary-sarcomatoid-carcinoma:-a-multi-center-retrospective-study</a>.-journal-of-thoracic-oncology-:-official-publication-of-the-international-association-for-the-study-of-lung-cancer.-2025;:s1556-0864\(25\)00967-0.-doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2025.07.121.)[[27]](#j-clin-oncol-42,-2024-\(suppl-16;-abstr-8555\))

**Diagnostic Recommendations for Needle Biopsy Specimens**

Based on our case and the literature review, we propose the following recommendations for diagnosing PSC on needle biopsy specimens:

1. **Maintain High Index of Suspicion:** Any spindle cell proliferation in a lung biopsy from an elderly patient with a mass lesion should raise suspicion for PSC, even if cytological atypia is subtle.

2. **Comprehensive Immunohistochemical Panel:** A systematic approach using cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2), TTF-1, Vimentin, ALK, and p53 is essential. Negativity for Napsin A or CK7 should not exclude PSC.

3. **Correlation with Clinical and Radiological Findings:** The clinical presentation (elderly patient, smoking history, peripheral mass) and radiological features should be integrated with pathological findings.

4. **Consider Rebiopsy if Necessary:** If the initial biopsy is non-diagnostic or shows only inflammatory/necrotic tissue, rebiopsy should be considered to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis and molecular testing.

5. **Preserve Tissue for Molecular Testing:** Given the high frequency of actionable mutations in PSC, tissue should be preserved for comprehensive molecular profiling, including MET exon 14 skipping mutation analysis.

6. **Avoid Frozen Section Diagnosis:** The distinction between PSC and inflammatory pseudotumor should not be attempted on frozen section due to significant morphological overlap.[[10]](#wick-mr,-ritter-jh,-nappi-o.-<a-target="_blank"-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7672783">inflammatory-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-of-the-lung:-report-of-three-cases-and-clinicopathologic-comparison-with-inflammatory-pseudotumors-in-adult-patients</a>.-human-pathology.-1995;26\(9\):1014-21.-doi:10.1016/0046-8177\(95\)90092-6.)

**Conclusion**

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma represents a diagnostic challenge, particularly on needle biopsy specimens where sampling limitations and morphological overlap with benign lesions may lead to misdiagnosis. Our case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for malignancy in spindle cell lesions of the lung and the critical role of comprehensive immunohistochemical evaluation. The combination of cytokeratin positivity, TTF-1 expression, vimentin co-expression, and p53 overexpression, along with negativity for myofibroblastic markers and ALK, supports the diagnosis of PSC. Accurate diagnosis is essential not only for prognostication but also for guiding molecular testing and targeted therapy, given the high frequency of actionable MET exon 14 skipping mutations in this tumor type.
